This is survey I created with HTML and CSS to collect feedback for my restaurant Zen Sushi & Grill. I found this project to be a great way to utilize my coding knowledge for the benefit of the restaurant. While developing this survey, I strengthened my understanding and use of <form> elements, radio buttons, checkboxes, HTML5 validation errors and <label> elements to discern between different answer selections. I also improved my website design by utilizing flexbox, image backgrounds and mobile responsiveness through adjusting the initial-scale.
